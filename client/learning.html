          <strong>Learn by Building</strong><br />
          GUMMI helps learners move beyond theory by working on real problems,
          real ideas, and real projects.

        <h1 class="why-t">Why Gummi</h1>
        <p>
          GUMMI is built for people who don’t just want to consume content—but
          want to understand, apply, and create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of passive learning, GUMMI encourages active thinking,
          collaboration, and real-world experience. Here, ideas are allowed to
          be unfinished, learning is visible, and progress matters more than
          perfection.
